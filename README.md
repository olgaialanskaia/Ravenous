This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

The project tasks were divided in four parts:

## Part I
Creating Static Components

## Part II
Passing Information to Components

## Part III
Setting the State of Ravenous Components

## Part IV
Interacting with the Yelp API

### A quick overview of how Ravenous functions:

* As a user, I should be able to search for restaurants
* As a user, I should be able to view a list of restaurants returned by the Yelp API
* As a user, I should be able to sort through restaurants using a filter
